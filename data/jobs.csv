we are founded on the belief that humans should be at the heart of everything we do, and have adopted a people-first and collaborative mindset to ensure we collectively drive real and ethically-sound results.

as an applied research scientist in the financial products group at element ai, you will sit in a cross-functional team with several other people with a diversity of skill sets and you will enjoy a unique opportunity to use your creativity towards applying cutting edge machine learning and operations research methods to problems with significant impact in the financial industry. while doing so you will have access to the best hardware and you will be assisted by a team of it experts and software developers, to ensure most of your time is spent on core r&d; challenges.

what you'll do

you will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your ai/ml expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. you will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. this will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and and translating them into solutions that address those needs.

you will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical machine learning methods, but you are enthusiastic at the idea of pushing the boundaries of deep learning and ai.

finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission.

what we're looking for

you have significant understanding of the underlying theory of machine learning, operations research or related ai field. in the financial products group, we are specifically interested in skill sets related to reinforcement learning, dynamic programming, deep learning, time series analysis & forecasting, optimization, simulation, generative models, and similar. this expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. you're also a solid programmer and you're comfortable doing scientific programming as well as product development and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks. this includes embracing modern devops principles to development and working in a setting where code is expected to be shared and peer-reviewed.

you understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arises in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset, and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. you embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it.

you learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date in the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer.

what we offer for your valuable work:

work closely with other ai enthusiasts;
enjoy your work and life harmony;

qualifications

software / technology skills required
to be successful in this role, the data scientists will need to have in-depth knowledge of existing industry-standard ml platforms such as r and python, and ai platforms built in these environments such as: microsoft’s cognitive toolkit (cntk), keras and pytorch. further, to solve optimization problems, the data scientist should have knowledge of numerical solvers available in r such as optim() and optimx(), and have knowledge of solving optimization problems in mathematica and/or matlab.
further, it must be recognized that this position involves being at the fore-front of new technologies in the ml/ai world. since most of our data science projects are based off microsoft technologies such as ml server (python server + r server) which are increasingly being implemented in successive versions of sql server and powerbi, the data scientist will have to constantly be up-to-date with these latest trends and implementations.
working with other members of the analytics team
the current analytics team consists of experts in data visualization/interaction, data engineers who maintain the data structures and queries in sql server and who operationalize the r/python scripts for large-scale production, and a forecasting and pricing analytics expert.
this role will involve continuous and close collaboration with all of the aforementioned groups. in particular, the main role of the principal data scientist will be to prototype/design algorithms, and implement them using the appropriate software libraries. they will then work closely with the database/data engineering team to implement these algorithms for “productionalization” so that they can be run “at scale” and on a regular schedule. the data scientist will also make use of live data provided by this team to build algorithms that can make use of live data for the most accurate models possible.
this role will also involve close collaboration with the forecasting and pricing analytics data scientist. in particular, this role will function in two ways. part of the time, the forecasting and pricing analytics data scientist will design a forecasting model of which the principal data scientist will then help to implement in a “big data” setting in an efficient manner. the role will also function in the opposite direction as well. the principal data scientist will also design/implement forecasting models which the forecasting and pricing analytics data scientist will manage and maintain on a regular basis.
finally, this role will involve close collaboration with the data visualization team who will be responsible for implementing the user interface behind the various ml solutions for business consumption. this will either be in the form of the principal data scientist being responsible for handing over data in the form of tables in sql server of which the visualization team will make dashboards in powerbi “from scratch” or taking over a rough dashboard/visualization created by the principal data scientist to make it more appropriate for wide business consumption.

curious: you ask why, you explore, you’re not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. you probably know python, scala, or java and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
a wrangler: you know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an api, bring it through a transformation or two, and convert into a human-readable form (matplotlib, d3 visualization, tableau, etc.).
a stickler for good software: you have a reverence for devops and don’t consider any piece of code complete without a thorough testing suite.
creative: big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don’t frighten you. you’re used to working with abstract data and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
proactive: you will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.
